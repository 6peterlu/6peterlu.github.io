							<p><strong>> <em>Software Engineering Intern at Sift Science</em></strong><br/><br/>
							<strong>Involves: Java, MapReduce, Hadoop, Flow2 DAG framework</strong><br/><br/>
							Working at Sift was my first taste of being part of a high-energy startup, moving quickly to implement features and frequently interfacing with the leadership in the company to stay on track. I worked across a variety of Sift's core products to improve our machine learning model performance and speed of our testing pipeline. I learned how important it is to be transparent, to always be communicating, and never, ever stop learning and exploring.

							<p><strong>> <em>Core Organizer at TreeHacks</em></strong><br/><br/>
							<strong>Involves: Project management, Networking, Communication</strong><br/><br/>
							Over the half-year grind that is organizing Stanford's premier hackathon, I discovered that computer science is more than code on a screen. As the lead on judging, my task was to recruit talented experts in the Bay Area to help judge the project expo at the end of the event. I coordinated nearly 50 judges to judge over 100 projects to choose finalists. Staying organized and maintaining awareness of the other aspects of TreeHacks was key.

							<p><strong>> <em>Biocomputation Researcher at Koong Lab</em></strong><br/><br/>
							<strong>Involves: Python, Cytoscape, Torch, Lab techniques, Clinical shadowing</strong><br/><br/>
							I started at the Koong Lab testing experimental drugs against XBP1s in breast cancer cells, but my role evolved over time to leveraging my scripting ability to improve the efficiency of the lab in other ways. I automated several segments of our data processing pipeline as part of a large Stanford Hospital project to predict prognoses of patients based on natural language processing of their clinical notes. Computer science has tremendous potential to improve healthcare for all, and I plan to be on the forefront of those efforts.

							<p><strong>> <em>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Cancer Detection</em></strong><br/><br/>
							<strong>Involves: Tensorflow, Numpy, Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 dataset, Google Cloud</strong><br/><br/>
							<a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/518.pdf" target="_blank" id="text-link">link to paper</a><br/><br/>
							Numpy for data preprocessing, Tensorflow for neural network framework. Created an attention network to first identify regions of interest in CT scans, and fed these regions of interest into a classifier network sharing a similar architecture to GoogLeNet, but adapted for 3D data. Final AUC was much improved over using a 3D classifier alone.

							<p><strong>> <em>Threadpool</em></strong><br/><br/>
							<strong>Involves: C++, multithreading</strong><br/><br/>
							Wrote a thread manager, and used it to pull news articles off of the internet, as well as support basic MapReduce. Tackled issues with concurrency and multithreading using mutexes, semaphores, and condition variable any.

							Designed and wrote a large part of a published Android app designed to help educate college students and partygoers about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, and serve as a tool to prevent such consumption. Also took on the role of project manager, segmenting project into tasks, assigning to team members, and ensuring milestones were reached in efficient time frames.
